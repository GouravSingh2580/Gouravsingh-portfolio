## About

I blog , make videos , and recently founded an Academic mentorship platform called Careerhub .None of the activities done are out of mere conscious control, none done for the sake of doing them. It’s all a product of disco-ing ideas squared and luck cubed, with a “tiny” effort everywhere to make the best of the moment, to bring out my best to bestify whatever I do.
